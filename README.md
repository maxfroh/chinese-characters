# Chinese Character Recognition

## Datasets Used
[Chinese MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/chinese-mnist)


## Goals
- [X] Train model on Chinese MNIST dataset
    - [ ] Investigate if the model can be changed for performance
    - [ ] See if the å…­ diagnosis is a feature of the model
- [X] Implement UI to draw characters
    - [X] Implement shrinking (256x256 => 64x64)
    - [ ] Convert to pygame for better performance? (branch)
    - [ ] Investigate modifying drawing interface/shrinking technique for accuracy
- [X] Create mapper between drawing and tensor
- [X] Implement guessing app
- [ ] Repeat for characters
    - [ ] New branch with new model
